# BACKEND-SECURITY-CHECKLIST.md

Security review checklist for backend work.
Run the relevant sections before shipping any feature that touches auth, data, payments,
uploads, admin access, external callbacks, or account management.

This is not a one-time setup checklist. Run it per-feature, per-change.

---

## How to Use This File

1. Identify which sections apply to the current change.
2. Work through each item in those sections.
3. Mark `[x]` for passed, `[!]` for failed/at-risk, `[-]` for not applicable.
4. For any `[!]` item — do not ship until it is resolved or explicitly accepted with a documented reason.
5. Paste the completed relevant sections into the CHANGELOG entry under Verification.

## [A] Authentication

- [ ] Login endpoint does not reveal whether email exists (use identical error messages)
- [ ] Login is rate limited — brute force is not possible
- [ ] Failed login attempts are logged with IP and timestamp
- [ ] MFA support exists or is explicitly out of scope with documented reason
- [ ] Account lockout or exponential backoff implemented after N failed attempts
- [ ] Password-based auth uses a slow hash function (bcrypt, argon2, scrypt)
- [ ] Auth tokens are not logged in plain text anywhere
- [ ] OAuth/SSO flows validate `state` parameter to prevent CSRF
- [ ] OAuth/SSO flows validate `redirect_uri` against a strict allowlist
- [ ] Auth endpoints return consistent response times (no timing oracle)

---

## [B] Authorization & Access Control

- [ ] Every route/endpoint has explicit authorization — no route relies on "security by obscurity"
- [ ] Authorization is enforced server-side — never trust client-supplied role or permission claims
- [ ] Resource ownership is verified before any read, update, or delete operation
- [ ] Horizontal privilege escalation is not possible (user A cannot access user B's data)
- [ ] Vertical privilege escalation is not possible (user cannot self-assign elevated roles)
- [ ] Admin-only routes are protected by role check — not just by "not linking to them"
- [ ] Multi-tenant data is strictly isolated — cross-tenant data leakage is not possible
- [ ] Soft-deleted or inactive records are excluded from normal queries
- [ ] Permission checks happen at the data layer, not only at the route layer

---

## [C] Input Validation & Output Safety

- [ ] All user input is validated server-side — client-side validation is UX only
- [ ] Input validation uses an allowlist approach (define what is valid, reject everything else)
- [ ] String lengths are bounded — no unbounded text fields accepted
- [ ] Numeric ranges are validated — no negative quantities, no out-of-range values
- [ ] File types are validated by content (magic bytes), not just by extension or MIME header
- [ ] JSON input is validated against a schema before use
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements or a safe ORM — no raw string interpolation
- [ ] HTML output is escaped — user-supplied content cannot inject scripts (XSS)
- [ ] `Content-Type` headers are set correctly on all responses
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header present
- [ ] Redirect destinations are validated against an allowlist — open redirect is not possible
- [ ] Path traversal is not possible in file operations (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`)

---

## [D] Password & Credential Handling

- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost ≥ 12), argon2id, or scrypt — never MD5/SHA1/SHA256 alone
- [ ] Password reset tokens are cryptographically random (≥ 32 bytes), not predictable
- [ ] Password reset tokens expire (recommend: 15–60 minutes)
- [ ] Password reset tokens are single-use — invalidated immediately after use
- [ ] Password reset does not reveal whether the email is registered
- [ ] Old password is required to change password (not just a reset token)
- [ ] Password reset flow invalidates all existing sessions after reset
- [ ] Password history check prevents immediate reuse (if policy requires)
- [ ] Temporary passwords / magic links are single-use and short-lived
- [ ] Credentials are never logged, even partially

---

## [E] Session & Token Management

- [ ] Session tokens are cryptographically random and not guessable
- [ ] Session tokens are rotated after privilege change (login, role change, password reset)
- [ ] Sessions are invalidated on logout — not just cleared on the client
- [ ] Session expiry is enforced server-side — not just by cookie TTL
- [ ] JWT signatures are verified on every request — `alg: none` is rejected
- [ ] JWT expiry (`exp`) is enforced
- [ ] JWT audience (`aud`) and issuer (`iss`) are validated
- [ ] Refresh tokens are rotated on use (rotation + invalidation of old token)
- [ ] Refresh token reuse is detected and treated as a breach signal
- [ ] Session cookies have `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` attributes
- [ ] Tokens are not stored in `localStorage` (use `HttpOnly` cookies or memory)
- [ ] Concurrent session limits are defined and enforced (if policy requires)

---

## [F] API Security

- [ ] All API endpoints require authentication unless explicitly public
- [ ] Public endpoints are explicitly documented and reviewed
- [ ] CORS origin is set to an explicit allowlist — `*` is not used in production
- [ ] CORS allows only required methods and headers
- [ ] HTTP methods are enforced — GET endpoints do not accept POST and vice versa
- [ ] API versioning strategy is defined — old versions are not silently deprecated
- [ ] GraphQL (if used): introspection disabled in production, query depth limited
- [ ] GraphQL (if used): query cost analysis or complexity limits implemented
- [ ] Batch endpoints validate that all requested items belong to the requesting user
- [ ] Response payloads do not include fields the user is not authorized to see
- [ ] Sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, secrets) are never returned in API responses

---

## [G] Data Integrity & Database Safety

- [ ] Write operations are wrapped in transactions where atomicity is required
- [ ] Concurrent writes are handled safely — no race conditions on critical counters or balances
- [ ] Idempotency keys used for operations that must not be duplicated (payments, emails)
- [ ] Migrations are tested on a copy of production data before running in production
- [ ] Migrations have a rollback path (down migration) tested and verified
- [ ] No migration drops a column or table without a deprecation period
- [ ] Bulk operations (delete, update) have a row-count sanity check before execution
- [ ] Soft delete is used for user-owned records — hard delete is not the default
- [ ] Database backups are tested — not just scheduled but actually restored and verified
- [ ] Connection pool limits are configured — unbounded connections are not possible

---

## [H] File Upload & Storage

- [ ] File type is validated by content (magic bytes) — not by extension or Content-Type header
- [ ] File size limit is enforced server-side
- [ ] Uploaded files are stored outside the web root or in object storage — not publicly served directly
- [ ] Uploaded filenames are sanitized or replaced entirely — user-supplied names are not trusted
- [ ] Uploaded files are scanned for malware (if required by risk level)
- [ ] Executable file types are blocked (.sh, .exe, .php, .py, .js, .html, etc.)
- [ ] SVG uploads are treated as untrusted HTML — sanitized or not rendered inline
- [ ] Signed URLs with expiry are used for private file access
- [ ] Object storage bucket is not publicly readable by default
- [ ] Upload metadata (original filename, uploader, timestamp) is logged

---

## [I] Payment & Billing

- [ ] Payment amounts are calculated server-side — never trust client-supplied price
- [ ] Coupon/discount logic is validated server-side — not applied on client
- [ ] Currency and amount are validated before passing to payment provider
- [ ] Idempotency keys are used for all charge/capture operations
- [ ] Payment provider webhooks are verified by signature before processing
- [ ] Duplicate webhook events are handled idempotently
- [ ] Failed payments are logged with enough context for support
- [ ] Refund logic requires an explicit authorization check
- [ ] Free trial abuse (multiple accounts) is considered and mitigated if applicable
- [ ] PCI scope is understood — card data never touches your servers if using tokenization

---

## [J] Webhooks & External Callbacks

- [ ] Webhook signatures are verified using the provider's signing secret
- [ ] Raw request body is used for signature verification — parsed body is not
- [ ] Webhook events are processed idempotently — duplicate delivery is safe
- [ ] Webhook handler responds `2xx` before processing (to avoid timeout retries causing side effects)
- [ ] Webhook source IP is validated if provider publishes a fixed IP range
- [ ] Webhook payload is validated against expected schema before acting on it
- [ ] Replay attacks are mitigated by checking event timestamp freshness
- [ ] Failed webhook processing is logged with the full event payload for retry

## [K] Secret & Key Management

- [ ] No secrets in source code, comments, or commit history
- [ ] No secrets in environment variable names that appear in logs or error messages
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore` — verified in current repo
- [ ] Secrets are stored in a secrets manager or encrypted vault (not plaintext in a DB column)
- [ ] API keys and secrets are scoped to minimum required permissions
- [ ] Secrets rotation process exists and is documented
- [ ] Leaked secret response plan exists: revoke → rotate → audit → notify
- [ ] Service accounts and API keys are per-environment (staging keys ≠ production keys)
- [ ] Internal service-to-service calls use signed tokens, not hardcoded shared secrets

## [L] Audit Logging

- [ ] Auth events are logged: login, logout, failed login, password reset, MFA change
- [ ] Privilege changes are logged: role assignment, permission grant/revoke
- [ ] Sensitive data access is logged: PII export, admin data view, bulk queries

- [ ] Logs are append-only — users and non-admin services cannot modify or delete logs
- [ ] Log retention period is defined and compliant with applicable regulations
- [ ] Logs do not contain passwords, tokens, or full payment card numbers

---

## [M] Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection

- [ ] Auth endpoints are rate limited by IP and by account
- [ ] Password reset endpoint is rate limited
- [ ] Account creation is rate limited to prevent mass registration
- [ ] API endpoints have per-user rate limits

- [ ] File upload endpoint is rate limited
- [ ] Rate limit responses use `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header
- [ ] Rate limit state is stored server-side — not client-supplied

---

## [N] Email & Notification Security

- [ ] Unsubscribe links use signed tokens — not guessable user IDs
- [ ] Email verification tokens are single-use and expire
- [ ] Notification content does not include sensitive data in plain text (e.g., full card number)
- [ ] Outbound email uses SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
- [ ] Email sender address is fixed and not user-configurable without validation
- [ ] HTML emails sanitize any user-supplied content before rendering

---

## [O] Admin & Privileged Access

- [ ] Admin panel is on a separate route with explicit role check
- [ ] Admin actions require re-authentication for destructive operations
- [ ] Admin impersonation (acting as another user) is logged with the admin's identity
- [ ] Admin-only APIs are not accessible by regular user tokens — tested explicitly
- [ ] Admin access is MFA-required (or documented exception with reason)
- [ ] Admin account enumeration is not possible from admin login endpoint errors
- [ ] Inactive admin accounts are disabled or removed

---

## [P] Dependency & Supply Chain

- [ ] Dependencies are pinned to exact versions in production
- [ ] `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / equivalent run and findings reviewed
- [ ] No packages with known critical CVEs in use

---

## [Q] Error Handling & Information Leakage

- [ ] Stack traces are never returned to the client in production
- [ ] Database errors are caught and returned as generic messages — no schema leakage
- [ ] 404 and 403 responses are indistinguishable for private resources (no oracle)
