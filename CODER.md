## Architecture Notes

- This is currently a frontend-only React app. Do not imply production auth, media streaming, payments, or persistence until those systems are implemented.
- Catalog content is centralized in `src/data/mockContent.ts`. Existing pages and components expect the `ContentItem`, `Season`, `Episode`, and `CastMember` shapes.
- App routing lives in `src/App.tsx` using React Router. Shared app layout wraps route pages through `AppLayout`.
- The `@` import alias maps to `src` in `vite.config.ts`.
- Demo persistence uses `localStorage` through `src/lib/storage.ts`, `src/lib/avatarStore.ts`, and `src/lib/storageKeys.ts`.
- Design tokens are defined as CSS variables in `src/index.css` and surfaced through Tailwind names in `tailwind.config.js`.
- The app uses Radix UI primitives for several base components and custom streaming-specific components for product surfaces.
- `vite.config.ts` sets `base: "./"` for static deployment compatibility.
- Workspace note: `/home/fadz/projects/github/streamora` is not currently initialized as a git repository, even though the intended public remote is `https://github.com/Matsumiko/streamXie-ui.git`.

## Code Style & Conventions

- Use TypeScript types for component props and data contracts.
- Keep page-level screens in `src/pages`; keep shared UI in `src/components`.
- Preserve current Tailwind-heavy styling approach and token names instead of adding a second styling system.
- Keep streaming catalog data transformations close to route pages until a real API/data layer is introduced.
- Use semantic route names and React Router `Link`/`NavLink` for internal navigation.
- Prefer existing `PageContainer`, `SectionHeader`, card, modal, toast, and layout patterns.
- Keep comments sparse; add them only when they clarify non-obvious state or browser behavior.

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for the current frontend-only demo.

When backend/API integration is added, create `.env.example` with safe placeholder names and document each variable here. Do not store real secret values in this file or in repository docs.

## Known Gotchas

### Frontend-only auth

**Problem:** Login, registration, reset password, and profile screens can look production-ready.  
**Why it happens:** They are UI flows only and are not connected to a backend session system.  
**How to avoid:** Document them as mock flows until a real auth provider, session handling, and security review exist.

### Mock catalog source

**Problem:** Pages import directly from `src/data/mockContent.ts`.  
**Why it happens:** The project is currently a starter/demo UI.  
**How to avoid:** Add a dedicated data adapter before replacing mock data with API calls so page components do not become tightly coupled to fetch logic.

### Local storage state

**Problem:** My List, watch progress, and avatar preferences reset per browser/profile and are not account-based.  
**Why it happens:** State is stored in browser `localStorage`.  
**How to avoid:** Replace storage helpers with backend-backed services when adding real users.

### Package scripts

**Problem:** There are no lint, test, or typecheck scripts yet.  
**Why it happens:** The project currently ships as a UI starter.  
**How to avoid:** Add scripts and CI before accepting external pull requests.
